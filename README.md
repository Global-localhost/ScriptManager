## Requirements
* This app doesn't need ROOT Access for normal use. However, due to the restricted permissions of android eco-system, executing root commands from app won't work without ROOT Access enabled.

## Features
Script Manager is a simple and very basic app, with as elegant light/dark UI, which can do the following things
* Create, edit, share, and easily execute shell scripts.
* Import shell scripts from sdcard.
* Apply scripts on boot, either on post-fs or late_service as per user choice (only if rooted with Magisk).
